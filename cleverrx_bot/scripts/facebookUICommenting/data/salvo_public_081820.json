I could no longer work, and received help from military charities to secure Personal Independence Payment benefits and get access to counselling. I went on a few courses and realised every time that there was someone worse off than me. I needed a new focus and I decided it was time to give something back.\" Ex-reservist, Malcolm Lloyd, struggled with his mental health, which made it difficult for him to hold onto a job. Having worked driving trucks for most of his life, his depression and anxiety led to panic attacks and he was unable to carry on.  Then in October 2018, Malcolm became insulin dependent due to Type 2 diabetes and lost his licenses to drive heavy vehicles. After he was supported by military charities to access help and get back on his feet, Malcolm decided he wanted to give back too by joining SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity as a Caseworker. \"Since I have become a caseworker, I\u2019ve had the push I needed to do more and I have purpose, which is to help others. I come from a veteran family; they don\u2019t like to ask for help. But these people have served and fought for their country \u2013 and if they\u2019re in need there are things we can do to change their life. It\u2019s a privilege to be asked, they\u2019re entitled to support, and I feel great knowing you\u2019ve improved things for them.\" \"When I first joined, I went on a caseworker course in Sandwich, Kent. I loved that course, it was brilliant. I made some really nice friends who I am still in contact with today. Dan was our trainer and he was brilliant. He was very good at explaining the role, safeguarding and what to do, covering each topic a number of times but in different ways to help us all learn.\" \"My biggest case so far was a guy who actually used to live two doors away from where I used to live. He was in the Royal Engineers for seven months and had a number of issues, including depression and drug and alcohol dependency.\" \"I was supporting him with a few issues relating to his health and some debt he was in, and he was beginning to turn his life around, attending courses. Then one day I got a call from my local Divisional Secretary to say that he\u2019d died. He was only 43. He\u2019d had a heart attack alone at home.\"   \"He had no family, or anyone to manage his funeral so I asked for funding and arranged it all. We secured \u00a32,600 to cover the costs. It was a lovely ceremony and we had a Royal Engineers flag proudly on display. A former padre performed the ceremony. SSAFA, The Royal British Legion and reserves from the Royal Engineers were all there. His ex-girlfriend gave a lovely speech.\" \"Afterwards, his ex-girlfriend told me, 'I can\u2019t thank you enough', the Divisional Secretary said, 'We\u2019re proud of you', and even my wife said to me, 'You\u2019ll have to pat yourself on the back for that one'. It\u2019s a pleasure, it\u2019s what SSAFA are here for.\" \"There are lots of different roles at SSAFA if you want to volunteer. I recently did a course to become a SSAFA mentor too, supporting veterans\u2019 transition. As a caseworker, you may only meet your clients once or twice as you help them, but with mentoring, it\u2019s ongoing, once a week for up to two years.
