I posted a few days ago...I currently recovered from Covid (I was in the hospital), prior to Covid I was able to manage my neuropathy...NOW I can barely breathe the pain is SO BAD. I had a visit with my neurologist last Thursday he noticed a bump on my arm, I'm getting a biopsy next 2 weeks. I'm waiting for the pain management clinic to approve me. I work from home..but sitting at the computer kills me... since covid my left hand is twice the size of my right... I have this unbearable pain that just started in my arm..my fingers are starting to curl, when this happens I have no control of my hand.  The intense burning in my calves and feet are more than I can handle.  The neurologist poked my left foot with 3 different needles..I couldn't feel it at all.  I NEVER SLEEP I'm going crazy.  I have no quality of life.  Covid has really really taken a toll on my neuropathy and my neurologist said they are still trying to figure out options for this.  I'm so afraid of losing my job I was once the top sales rep of the company.. now im the lowest..I can't think straight..I'm in so much pain.  I've tried marijuana, edibles (never again), I'm on 2400 mg of gabapentin, lyrica, cymbalta NOTHING IS WORKING!!!! My dr mentioned looking into SSI but idk how that works in terms of pay, I make a good amount of money and I dont know if SSI if approved matches your current pay...does anyone know how that works?
