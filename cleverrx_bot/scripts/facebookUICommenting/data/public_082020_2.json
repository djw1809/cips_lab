It is a disease of global health importance associated with high deaths rates and complications. In 2019 alone it was estimated that around a half a billion people worldwide had it. From 2009 to 2019, the number increased from 285 million to 463million, that an increase of 62%. Half of the 463million with Diabetes do not know they have it. Majority of those who don’t know that they have it are found in low and middle income countries, that is Botswana included. In Africa over two-thirds (66.7) of people with diabetes are unaware they have the disease. To bring the issue closer to home, the World Health Organization in 2019 reported that 6% of Botswana population had diabetes. Among scary issues were that 43% of our population is overweight while 19.5% was obese. The same organisation pointed out that 24.5% of our population was physically inactive.  In 2017 Mwita etal established that of the patients admitted in Princess Marina Hospital for acute heart failure 12.4% of the didn’t know they had diabetes compared to 15.5% who knew they had diabetes. In Botswana 32 per 1000 have diabetes but do not know they have it. It is on this background that Batswana need to be sensitized about Diabetes and further be encouraged to test for diabetes at any nearest health facility countrywide. #AwarenessWednesday #CampaignAgainstDiabetes Contributor: Dr Gomolemo Tiego","likes":"173","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3253565958059373","shares":"38 Shares","postid":"Insulin_0_2","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/BotswanaGovernment/posts/3253565958059373"},{"profile_link":"/Advanced-Wellness-Specialists-114932263535837/?__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"August 14 at 1:39 AM · ","content":"Worst things to do after a workout   Excluding fast-acting carbs It is of vital importance to quickly consume the proper nutrients after a workout, and carbs play a very important role in this equation.
