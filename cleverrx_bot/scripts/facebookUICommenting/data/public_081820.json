Allow it to sit for a few minutes and then scrape out the guts.  For the meatballs, I placed ground beef, 2 eggs, ground pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning in a bowl. I formed each meatball to be roughly 2 ounces.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and then I added a spoonful of Raos tomato sauce and some shredded mozzarella on top and I broiled them for 2 minutes.  So easy!

We did bloodwork, scheduled this around her heat cycles and will do bloodwork again tomorrow morning.  Her heat cycles make her blood sugars plummet.  One night, I was awakened to something annoying bumping into my leg.  It was Eve having a seizure because her blood sugar had crashed.  She is also at risk for pyometra and mammary cancer.  We never take surgery lightly and we always do what we feel is in the best interest of the individual dog.  Her lungs aren‚Äôt the best which is why we have waited until now. Eve is ready for everything but skipping breakfast.  Besides the usual post op care we will be monitoring her blood sugars very carefully.  Diabetes makes things more challenging but not impossible.

I could no longer work, and received help from military charities to secure Personal Independence Payment benefits and get access to counselling. I went on a few courses and realised every time that there was someone worse off than me. I needed a new focus and I decided it was time to give something back.\" Ex-reservist, Malcolm Lloyd, struggled with his mental health, which made it difficult for him to hold onto a job. Having worked driving trucks for most of his life, his depression and anxiety led to panic attacks and he was unable to carry on.  Then in October 2018, Malcolm became insulin dependent due to Type 2 diabetes and lost his licenses to drive heavy vehicles. After he was supported by military charities to access help and get back on his feet, Malcolm decided he wanted to give back too by joining SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity as a Caseworker. \"Since I have become a caseworker, I‚Äôve had the push I needed to do more and I have purpose, which is to help others. I come from a veteran family; they don‚Äôt like to ask for help. But these people have served and fought for their country ‚Äì and if they‚Äôre in need there are things we can do to change their life. It‚Äôs a privilege to be asked, they‚Äôre entitled to support, and I feel great knowing you‚Äôve improved things for them.\" \"When I first joined, I went on a caseworker course in Sandwich, Kent. I loved that course, it was brilliant. I made some really nice friends who I am still in contact with today. Dan was our trainer and he was brilliant. He was very good at explaining the role, safeguarding and what to do, covering each topic a number of times but in different ways to help us all learn.\" \"My biggest case so far was a guy who actually used to live two doors away from where I used to live. He was in the Royal Engineers for seven months and had a number of issues, including depression and drug and alcohol dependency.\" \"I was supporting him with a few issues relating to his health and some debt he was in, and he was beginning to turn his life around, attending courses. Then one day I got a call from my local Divisional Secretary to say that he‚Äôd died. He was only 43. He‚Äôd had a heart attack alone at home.\"   \"He had no family, or anyone to manage his funeral so I asked for funding and arranged it all. We secured ¬£2,600 to cover the costs. It was a lovely ceremony and we had a Royal Engineers flag proudly on display. A former padre performed the ceremony. SSAFA, The Royal British Legion and reserves from the Royal Engineers were all there. His ex-girlfriend gave a lovely speech.\" \"Afterwards, his ex-girlfriend told me, 'I can‚Äôt thank you enough', the Divisional Secretary said, 'We‚Äôre proud of you', and even my wife said to me, 'You‚Äôll have to pat yourself on the back for that one'. It‚Äôs a pleasure, it‚Äôs what SSAFA are here for.\" \"There are lots of different roles at SSAFA if you want to volunteer. I recently did a course to become a SSAFA mentor too, supporting veterans‚Äô transition. As a caseworker, you may only meet your clients once or twice as you help them, but with mentoring, it‚Äôs ongoing, once a week for up to two years. I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my first mentee!\" \"Who knows, one day I may even be a SSAFA Branch Secretary or Treasurer!\"","likes":"402","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=10164421159045284&refid=52","shares":"29 Shares","postid":"10164421159045284","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10164421159045284&id=343295970283&__xts__%5B0%5D=12.Abr6BC6iStRIQhrUlHBE_tRJ96jR3bsOXdjqpuiQ-Zz6-oqwHXYgCdO-R-nXwdOQX7lBl5p3VvZKK5bzkW-WnYvTPjBz3_5NFhtDJvtdwO5A7w8opWEzsen7yqMAlTCVcq36BtLRed3IUYHTVfpDbE-EQTCJsKyh8QJ1qdLimvCmvo0dwOXxu_7yRjYBb0QU_6t969yqpvrNId-NNF-kMDA-WTO-gE1Sj-ACp5ghfqU-7y4cdpknINiCZgswTyLjzYTgKeDQFNFhYKZF7D0Eb5n8iSvqkIRYk42MRVcBek9waTVORqxge6_tup-YkdXqiWA"},{"profile_link":"/dianasbulbinella.enhoodia/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"17 hrs ¬∑ ","content":"REVIEW OCOTEA: for more than JUST weight loss ‚òòÔ∏è \"Frequently Asked Questions\" about OCOTEA WEIGHT LOSS DROPS ‚òòÔ∏èF.A.Q: (Everything you wanted to know about OCOTEA) ‚ñ∫‚òòÔ∏èQuestion 1: WHO CAN USE OCOTEA?

Definitely longer than a year!üêæ According to the top pet immunologist (aka vaccine expert) in the world, Dr. Ronald Schultz, Ph.D. ‚Äì ‚Äú Annual revaccination provides no benefit and may increase the risk for adverse reactions.‚Äù What the heck are adverse reactions (or side effects)? Well according to the other rock star pet immunologist Dr. Jean Dodds: ‚ÄúSide effects from dog vaccinations can occur anywhere from instantly up to several weeks or months later. Vaccines can even cause susceptibility to chronic diseases that appear much later in a dog‚Äôs life (Dodd, 2001). Severe and fatal adverse reactions include: ‚Ä¢Susceptibility to infections. ‚Ä¢Neurological disorders and encephalitis. ‚Ä¢Aberrant behavior, including unprovoked aggression. ‚Ä¢Vaccines are linked to seizures. Distemper, parvovirus, rabies and, presumably, other vaccines have been linked with poly neuropathy, a nerve disease that involves inflammation of several nerves. (Dodds,2001)‚Äù SO HOW LONG EXACTLY DOES YOUR PET‚ÄôS VACCINE LAST? According to the recommendations of the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), (basically the dudes who set the standards for the vets): ‚ÄúAmong healthy dogs, all commercially available [core] vaccines are expected to induce a sustained protective immune response lasting at least 5 yr. thereafter‚Äù Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the core vaccines from Dr. Ronald Schultz: Minimum Duration of Immunity for Canine Vaccines: Distemper- 7 years by challenge Parvovirus ‚Äì 7 years by challenge Adenovirus ‚Äì 7 years by challenge Canine rabies ‚Äì 3 years by challenge The moral of the story here, if you have no idea when your pet is due or has been vaccinated, then just run a titer test and this will confirm if you are due, rather than over-vaccinate your poor pet, setting the stage for future problems! What‚Äôs a titer test? A titer test (pronounced tight-errr) is a laboratory or in-house veterinary test measuring the existence and level of antibodies (necessary to fight off disease) in your pet‚Äôs blood. Basically, it‚Äôs a test that will tell you whether or not you actually need to vaccinate your pet. It‚Äôs also super useful when making a decision about vaccinating a pet with an unknown vaccination history, or for determining if pets have received immunity from vaccination. Vaccinating your pet is super important so don‚Äôt lose the overall message here: VACCINATE, JUST DON‚ÄôT OVER-VACCINATE!

There are diverse causes of neuropathy such as diabetes, renal failure, liver failure, chronic alcohol intake, hypothyroidism, few cancers, drug-induced and immune-mediated. Diabetes is the leading cause of neuropathy. Development of neuropathy in diabetic patient is related to the duration of diabetes and level of sugar control.  Symptoms and signs of neuropathy- o Pain  o Tingling, burning o Numbness  o Muscle weakness o Wasting of muscles Pain is a common and early feature of neuropathy. Neuropathic pain usually has characters like tingling, burning, stabbing or electric current like pain. Severity of pain may vary from mild to very severe and disabling pain that may disturb the sleep also. Moreover, when the condition is chronic like in diabetic neuropathy, it may have a negative impact on a person‚Äôs mental health too. For prevention of neuropathy and associated pain and other complications especially in a diabetic patient, certain steps are necessary- o Regular screening to detect diabetes early so that it does not remain undetected and untreated o Adequate sugar control o Dietary modifications o Regular exercise For the treatment of neuropathic pain clinician‚Äôs primary aim is to identify and treat the underlying cause of neuropathy. Along with this patients often require medications to control and suppress the pain associated with neuropathy. Management of neuropathic pain is different from nociceptive pain which often does not respond to simple painkillers. Moreover, excessive use of painkillers may further harm the body in a variety of ways. So treatment under the guidance of a doctor, some lifestyle modifications and positive outlook are necessary to overcome neuropathic pain and other related symptoms.

For the last 22 + years I have lived in daily chronic pain, muscle spasms, cluster migraines, gastro issues, reflux, insomnia, neuropathy, anxiety, depression, and I was overweight and had no energy at all. At 40 I had come to the realization this was my life.  At my mom's insistence, I started taking plant based supplements. That 1st week made a believer out of me. I felt better, had actual energy!  And I could tell my clothes were fitting better! I decided to become an Ambassador so I could try more products and get them for wholesale. When I added ProBio 5 and Biocleanse my gastric issues and reflux were gone. Also I realized in week 3 I had not needed my pain meds, muscle relaxers, or anxiety meds in over a week! Since then I have added XFactor and Nerve Support. I am off of 9 daily meds including Prednisone for the 1st time in six years! I have lost 2 pants sizes and tons of inches!  I no longer live my days in pain.  I have been given my life back, and I feel 20 years younger!\" *This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
