It is a disease of global health importance associated with high deaths rates and complications. In 2019 alone it was estimated that around a half a billion people worldwide had it. From 2009 to 2019, the number increased from 285 million to 463million, that an increase of 62%. Half of the 463million with Diabetes do not know they have it. Majority of those who don‚Äôt know that they have it are found in low and middle income countries, that is Botswana included. In Africa over two-thirds (66.7) of people with diabetes are unaware they have the disease. To bring the issue closer to home, the World Health Organization in 2019 reported that 6% of Botswana population had diabetes. Among scary issues were that 43% of our population is overweight while 19.5% was obese. The same organisation pointed out that 24.5% of our population was physically inactive.  In 2017 Mwita etal established that of the patients admitted in Princess Marina Hospital for acute heart failure 12.4% of the didn‚Äôt know they had diabetes compared to 15.5% who knew they had diabetes. In Botswana 32 per 1000 have diabetes but do not know they have it. It is on this background that Batswana need to be sensitized about Diabetes and further be encouraged to test for diabetes at any nearest health facility countrywide. #AwarenessWednesday #CampaignAgainstDiabetes Contributor: Dr Gomolemo Tiego","likes":"173","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=3253565958059373","shares":"38 Shares","postid":"Insulin_0_2","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/BotswanaGovernment/posts/3253565958059373"},{"profile_link":"/Advanced-Wellness-Specialists-114932263535837/?__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"August 14 at 1:39 AM ¬∑ ","content":"Worst things to do after a workout   Excluding fast-acting carbs It is of vital importance to quickly consume the proper nutrients after a workout, and carbs play a very important role in this equation.

His pod ran out of insulin today and before he could eat dinner we had to put a new one on. (He needs insulin for virtually everything he eats.) He draws the insulin, fills the pod, pairs his loop system and inserts the cannula  all by himself most days (with my supervision). Some days he wants my help and I gladly oblige ...other days he does it on his own. Today is a ‚ÄúI want help day‚Äù and that‚Äôs just fine by me. First, we look around his body to see where this insertion should go based on where his last one was, where his dexcom is, what he‚Äôs going to do for the next few days, and what his general feeling of what area of his body he wants to use. Then I prep his skin and squeeze the area around the pod and we joke around to try to distract him as it inserts.  We are a team. Some days  we need more and some days we need less from our teammates but the one constant is that the other person is always there to meet you right where you are that day.  #weneedacure #empathynotpity #support","likes":"2.3K","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=4179634272111012","shares":"33 Shares","postid":"Insulin_1_1","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/SavingLuke/posts/4179634272111012"},{"profile_link":"","datetime":"","content":"","likes":"68","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=1506357732879839","shares":"30 Shares","postid":"Insulin_1_2","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/DrStephenHussey/photos/a.218563861659239/1506357732879839/?type=3"},{"profile_link":"/profile.php?id=100004102774390&fref=nf&__tn__=-R","datetime":"July 29 at 8:32 PM ¬∑ ","content":"Diveshnie Mahen Govender","likes":"","likes_link":"","shares":"","postid":"neuropathy_0_0","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2192323747581030&id=100004102774390"},{"profile_link":"/NeuropathyReliefProject/?refid=52&__tn__=%7E-R","datetime":"August 4 at 5:12 AM ¬∑ ","content":"Always In Pain? 5 Things You Shouldn‚Äôt Feel Guilty For.
