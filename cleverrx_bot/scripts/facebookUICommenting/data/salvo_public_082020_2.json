Was put on lantus and humalog. I knew something was up when type 1 was so easy to handle. I barely needed humalog and I'm talking even after a carb fueled meal. Anywho, had the antibodies test and I am type 2. Doctor took me off humalog and put me on Janumet and kept me on lantus. I am sick as a dog to my stomach.
