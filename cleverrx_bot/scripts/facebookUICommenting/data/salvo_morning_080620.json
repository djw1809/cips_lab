I am 28 years old living in Indiana, USA. Before I am judged... I want you all to know exactly who I am and what I am going through. I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic at the age of 22 years old (through a c-peptide test that was inconclusive). I spent 3 years in and out of the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis (through ketone test strips and blood sugars being over 500mg/dL as well as tests in the hospital). My hemoglobin A1C was 14.0 at the time. It's better now, but the struggle is still the same (if not more difficult). 10 months after my diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, I was put directly on insulin... I am now having to be on u-500 of concentrated regular insulin and at insanely high amounts. On top of all that I went through... there were doctors trying to accuse me of not following my diet (in which I was following the diet that was given to me by the three endocrinologists that I see and I was following it to the letter) and I was gaining weight like crazy. I know the struggle that a lot of you are going through and to be honest... I wouldn't wish diabetes on anybody... Not even my worst enemy.  If you have diabetes, most of the time it is not a choice. At least mine wasn't. There are a lot of people who really don't understand. There are also a lot of people who actually believe that type 2 diabetes was a choice. I have to say that mine wasn't a choice. Now the only way that I can survive long term is to get bariatric surgery (in which I was approved for recently). I also have many other genetic factors that really contributed to my diabetes...", "likes": "28", "likes_link": "https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=928430444330811&refid=18", "shares": "1 share", "postid": "928430444330811", "postlink": "https://m.facebook.com/groups/218845138622682?view=permalink&id=928430444330811&refid=18&_ft_=qid.6857960865718866305%3Amf_story_key.928430444330811%3Agroup_id.218845138622682%3Atop_level_post_id.928430444330811%3Atl_objid.928430444330811%3Acontent_owner_id_new.100004665841423%3Apage_id.218845138622682%3Asrc.22%3Astory_location.6%3Afilter.GroupStoriesByActivityEntQuery%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%22218845138622682%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A218845138622682%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A100004665841423%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A657%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1596673006%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B928430444330811%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A6%7D%7D&__tn__=-R", "comment": "Diabetes is a significant problem for a well-being of people"}, {"profile_link": "/anastasia.kenner?groupid=218845138622682&refid=18&__tn__=-R", "datetime": "20 hrs \u00b7 ", "content": "Hi I\u2019m type 2 for 4 years now battling this thing. I\u2019m only on insulin because metformin causes gout to flare and the long acting only works for 2 hours on me. Anyone know why that would be? I was given samples of trulicity and am afraid to try it. Insulin is the only thing that truly works for me so far. I am drug sensitive & wonder if there is something else I can try that will help me further without reacting to it to much. I started walking everyday for the last month and am down 6lbs. I eat small meals, tons of veggies but my last a1c was 9.6 up from 8.2 3 8 months ago. I have a lot of stress with little work during this virus. My depression is high and I\u2019m trying to get the stress under control by walking. I also quit coffee again as that raises my sugars 50-70 points in the morning.", "likes": "6", "likes_link": "https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=928262031014319&refid=18", "shares": "", "postid": "928262031014319", "postlink": "https://m.facebook.com/groups/218845138622682?view=permalink&id=928262031014319&refid=18&_ft_=qid.6857960865901366874%3Amf_story_key.928262031014319%3Agroup_id.218845138622682%3Atop_level_post_id.928262031014319%3Atl_objid.928262031014319%3Acontent_owner_id_new.100000255285195%3Apage_id.218845138622682%3Asrc.22%3Astory_location.6%3Afilter.GroupStoriesByActivityEntQuery%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%22218845138622682%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A218845138622682%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A100000255285195%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A657%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1596656924%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B928262031014319%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A6%7D%7D&__tn__=-R", "comment": "Insulin is a little hard to afford."}]
