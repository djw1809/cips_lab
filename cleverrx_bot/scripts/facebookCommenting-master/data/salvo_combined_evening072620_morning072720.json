I have type 2 diabetes and just got out of the hospital from a 2nd small stroke. Its been scary to say the least.i have neuropathy in both my feet and my hands as well.im now on plavix and Lipitor to monitor my levels. My a1c started at 12.8 back in October  and is now down to 9.5 but still needs to go down. I'm eating a Mediterranean diet and am watching everything that I eat. I'm doing whatever I can to get this to stop. But since I am home I have times where my arm or leg will get numb and I'm wondering if that is the neuropathy or the small stroke. I had the first one back in November so I'm always nervous and anxious. This last one I spent 6 days in the hospital being tested every day. Please offer any advice as to what will help with this.i dobt want this to take over me.

this group before but I wanted to get my story out there if any symptoms like mine develop in any of you, get to the doctor. I am also hoping someone has had the same issues I have that I can talk to.  For 20 years I have had out of control diabetes - no diet, no meds/insulin the drs tried me on, no amt of diabetes education, research, or nutrition classes have helped, exercising is not reducing my BS levels. It does not matter how strict my diet is I cant get under 200.  I am on an Insulin Pump and my BS is in the mid 300s all the time.  2.4 units of Novolog is being pumped into me per hour. I have to take 40 to 70 units of Novolog at meals to get my bs down.  I have seen tons of Internal Medicine doctors and on my third Endocrynologist.   I started developing diabetic neurapathy from the get go so they put me on Gabapenten and it has been working well so far.  But then 3 years ago, I developed Hypothyroid and all the symptoms of that was overlapping with the symptoms I get from high blood sugar making me severely fatigued all the time.  On top of all that my Vitamin D has not come up in 20 years leaving my back in severe pain off and on when levels are low.  I am on 2 50,000 units of supplements and sitting in the sun when I can - not helping.  Then in late May, while doing a Cat Scan on my ears, a mass next to my Pituitary Gland was found - a Pituitary Adenoma Tumor.  I went to Neurosurgeon and he wants to leave this large tumor there - a Macroadenoma because it is not affecting my Optic Nerves.  However all my research has led to this tumor is probably leaning on the Pit Gland and causing my diabetes issues,  my thyroid issues which they have to up my med twice since May and my Vitamin D issues.  My new Endo is doing further test to try to find proof why I need this surgery to get this Neurosurgeon to operate. My insurance will only allow me one more opinion.  They sent me to a military Neurosurgeon who is using all these scare tactics on me. I know the risk and I know the surgery will be dangerous. I just know these issues are being caused by the tumor and not anything I am doing wrong. I have tried everything under the sun to get my diabetes controlled and nothing I do or doctors do is working.", "likes": "2", "likes_link": "https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=2931377700318755&refid=18", "shares": "", "postid": "2931377700318755", "postlink": "https://m.facebook.com/groups/814848708638342?view=permalink&id=2931377700318755&refid=18&_ft_=qid.6854231214526522147%3Amf_story_key.2931377700318755%3Agroup_id.814848708638342%3Atop_level_post_id.2931377700318755%3Atl_objid.2931377700318755%3Acontent_owner_id_new.628366221%3Apage_id.814848708638342%3Asrc.22%3Astory_location.6%3Afilter.GroupStoriesByActivityEntQuery%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%22814848708638342%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A814848708638342%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A628366221%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A657%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1595862935%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B2931377700318755%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A6%7D%7D&__tn__=-R", "comment": "Diabetes can be a waste of time and lives."}, {"profile_link": "/profile.php?id=100038502366865&fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=-R", "datetime": "4 hrs \u00b7 ", "content": "Hello all I have a question, this has been confusing me all weekend. According to the American diabetes association you have type 2 diabetes if A1c is 6.5 or higher or 126 mg/dl or higher. Yet this chart ( not from them but there is many online that agree) a 6.0 is the equivalent to 126. If that is correct then this info seems contradictory as according to A1c 6.0 is in the middle or pre diabetic range and 126 is type 2 . IF 126 and 6.0 are equivalent then according to A1c you are pre diabetic but according to mg/dl you have type 2, obviously this is contradictory .
