The neuropathy hurts so bad in my legs but it\u2019s my stomach that\u2019s worse.  I did however get an ultrasound for my cold legs today and heard my heartbeat while it was being done. Hope that\u2019s a good sign.  I\u2019m so lost here.  I have been on metformin and a BP med amlodipine since diagnosis a year ago.

I am a diabetic, \u201cconsidered as uncontrolled\u201d by MD.  I was diagnosed in 2014, after my A1C labs came back at 8.8.  However, since I worked for Kaiser Permanente at the time, I decided to do some research on my own regarding my ailment; I read up about all of the side effects for most of the diabetes medications, hmmm.., I refused any kind of medication......I flat out told my MD not \u201cFn\u201d happening. I told her I would take control of my diabetes through diet and exercise.  So I did, and within 90 days I went back to get an A1C recheck, my digits had dropped to 6.0 a significant drop.  My MD did not try to push any kind of meds on me again, she knew I was very serious about taking control and getting better.  However she was adamant that I check my BS daily and keep it within the 120 range.   So I was now on my new journey and that was for me to take care of me the best I could. Also, I truly did not plan for it, but as a side effect, I dropped 90lbs.  That definitely was not in my plans. I was not even trying to loose weight, it just happened, I had topped out at 340lbs, and started loosing what a great incentive.  I had maintained 250lbs for quite sometime, but just couldn\u2019t seem to shed anymore with what I was doing.  Of course I had never heard of IF or Keto until May of this year.  It was my son who introduced me to this way of eating.   He told me that I was basically already eating the Keto way but I should incorporate an IF plan as well.  After more research on IF and Keto, I found it to be an easy crossover for me.  I jumped right in and started immediately with an 18:6 routine, with a 44 hr Fast on the weekends.  With more research, I also found out that some of the veggies I had not given up along with a lot of fruit were detrimental to me and what I was trying to do, \u201clive longer\u201d.  I then understood why my weight had stalled back then.  At that time I wasn\u2019t aware of all the other options I had available to me.   So now it\u2019s  2018 and time to retire, so what do I do, of course I managed to pack on 38lbs....I stopped my exercise, and walking, I got lazy.  So when I stepped onto the scale and looked down at the numbers, I was not very happy with myself.  I knew then that something had to change again for me because I refused to take Metformin or Insulin injections.   I am happy to say that since 5/25 of starting my new life style I have shed 20lbs of those 38lbs.    I am on a roll now, and I know now that I will make my goal of 155lbs.  I\u2019ve been shedding 2lbs consistently since my 5/25 start; and my BS has become more stable, between 108 to 135 depending on before meals or after meals.   So I am tickled to have found another group to relate to and tell my story too and be someone else\u2019s support if needed. That\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it.", "likes": "47", "likes_link": "https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=2634952186817230&refid=18", "shares": "", "postid": "2634952186817230", "postlink": "https://m.facebook.com/groups/1804742759838181?view=permalink&id=2634952186817230&refid=18&_ft_=qid.6852846967914058347%3Amf_story_key.2634952186817230%3Agroup_id.1804742759838181%3Atop_level_post_id.2634952186817230%3Atl_objid.2634952186817230%3Acontent_owner_id_new.1566930557%3Apage_id.1804742759838181%3Asrc.22%3Astory_location.6%3Afilter.GroupStoriesByActivityEntQuery%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%221804742759838181%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A1804742759838181%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A1566930557%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A657%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1595509835%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B2634952186817230%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A6%7D%7D&__tn__=-R", "comment": "Diabetes is a expensive problem in the u.s.
