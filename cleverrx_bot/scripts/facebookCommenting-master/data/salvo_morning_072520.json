Hi my name is Ny\u2019Shara and I\u2019m 20 years old. I got diagnosed in 2018 and I ended up in the ICU for a few weeks where I almost died. My A1v was incredibly high. I was on so many medications and insulin drip for days. After I finally got out of the ICU I was depressed and I got into a car accident a week later. 2018 was a very rough year. Things went down hill. From the ICU to depression to the car accident to be kicked out of my house to being on all of these new diabetic medications to being poor to not going to college and not knowing my major. My point of making this is that I didn\u2019t want to change at first. I also didn\u2019t know how to. The only one I really had was my sisters and brother and my mom and grandma sometimes. And my long distance boyfriend who lives in Cali while I in Michigan for a year. I also don\u2019t like asking for help lol. I was a vegetarian and I lovedddd carbs. My point of making this is that I went to a diabetes retreat. I meet people who actually knew what I was going through and didn\u2019t make me feel insane and then I found these groups here on Facebook. And I saw that I could change. Now I\u2019m a pollotarian and I don\u2019t drink or eat sugar anymore. I left the carbs and I\u2019m eating much better. I\u2019m working again and I\u2019m better with my family. My boyfriend and I aren\u2019t doing LDR right now and we\u2019re almost to our three year. I\u2019m going to college this winter and I figured out that I\u2019m gonna be a double major in communications and creative writing with a vet assist certificate. And yesterday my doctor said I lost 10 pounds from the beginning of the year and my A1c level went from 9.1 last year to 6.4 currently! I\u2019m doing better and it took me a long time to get here but you can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t wanna be helped. I used to be that someone. Or at least I didn\u2019t know how to ask. I hope someone sees this and knows that you can do anything if you trust yourself and want better things for yourself. Even with this pandemic it\u2019ll get better. Thank you for listening if anyone did. \ud83d\ude02 ahhhh Im so excited!! Okay sorry.
