Been reading everyone's post in neuropathy. I have type 2 diabetes and just got out of the hospital from a 2nd small stroke. Its been scary to say the least.i have neuropathy in both my feet and my hands as well.im now on plavix and Lipitor to monitor my levels. My a1c started at 12.8 back in October  and is now down to 9.5 but still needs to go down. I'm eating a Mediterranean diet and am watching everything that I eat. I'm doing whatever I can to get this to stop. But since I am home I have times where my arm or leg will get numb and I'm wondering if that is the neuropathy or the small stroke. I had the first one back in November so I'm always nervous and anxious. This last one I spent 6 days in the hospital being tested every day. Please offer any advice as to what will help with this.i dobt want this to take over me.
