My feet are feeling really good now I think due to this medical procedure (which should be covered by insurance, but usually it is not), because I think my feet are actually healthier with improved circulation it's no wonder. And it also seems to last, I havent had this procedure for about 4 months now and if my feet remain as they are - I can live very comfortably without pain killers. I used to be very uncomfortable, I couldnt take a shower the water hitting my feet was unbearable, I had to wear socks at night, now I dont. The tingles and burning and shooting pain have been reduced to a tiny roar. Do I still have neuropathy? you bet I do. I know it there due to a low level of numbness. But I can feel everything, my feet are warm and pink. They used to be cold, irritated, and I suffered from dry skin in the Winter. Now I dont.  So the neuropathy  seems to be either well controlled, extremely marginalized, or actually getting better... and, yes, I consider it to be a miracle. Ill have 2  60 minute sessions one tomorrow and one on Thursday. I will be walking on air. I want all of you here to be feeling better, able to rest, be pain free, etc. Ill share an article about the use of hyper baric oxygen therapy as soon as I get the link or a copy of the article.

They didn't take in consideration the strength. So my great doctor is calling in an ointment instead bc they will pay for that. I personally think an ointment of lidocaine would be even better. So if you come up with the same problem try the ointment instead.
