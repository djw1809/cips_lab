So for a month and a half before my A1C checkup last week I was on 3 units of 70/30 and the doctor a month before added metformin 500mg twice a day  to start the transition of getting off the insulin. Then the 4.8 A1C from a 14.8 came back and like we planned we stopped the insulin and now I’ve been on metformin 1000mg twice a day. I was told the numbers would just slightly increase over the next few days as the result of the insulin being withdrawn.  My numbers are still running good and not changing anything up.  I’m seeing more of a flattening out in my numbers and it’s been now 5 days since I’ve been on insulin.   I was told that I’m gonna see numbers I’m not used to yet I’m familiar with even with being on the insulin. So today as you can see my fasting was 103 compared to all the other days you see.    Just looking to see if any of you have experienced the transition for insulin to not being on it. Also I’m gonna start not checking the fasting and 2 hour after meals every meal soon. Maybe just my fasting and the doc said one day check 2 hours after breakfast or lunch or dinner depending on schedule.","likes":"4","likes_link":"https://m.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=906420203198502&refid=18","shares":"","postid":"906420203198502","postlink":"https://m.facebook.com/groups/218845138622682?view=permalink&id=906420203198502&refid=18&_ft_=qid.6846443700831140225%3Amf_story_key.906420203198502%3Agroup_id.218845138622682%3Atop_level_post_id.906420203198502%3Atl_objid.906420203198502%3Acontent_owner_id_new.904565444%3Apage_id.218845138622682%3Asrc.22%3Aphoto_id.10163884406760445%3Astory_location.6%3Astory_attachment_style.photo%3Afilter.GroupStoriesByActivityEntQuery%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%22218845138622682%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A218845138622682%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22group%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A904565444%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A657%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1594038296%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntGroupMallPostCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B906420203198502%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A6%7D%7D&__tn__=-R"},{"profile_link":"/liandra.t.garcia?fref=nf&refid=18&__tn__=-R","datetime":"6 hrs · ","content":"Anyone use omnipod or omnipod dash?
